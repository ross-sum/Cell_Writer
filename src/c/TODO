Bug Reports:

  * Xorg 7.3/LinuxWacom 7.8.3 (patched) will crash the X server when
    XChangeKeyboardMapping() is called! Test again when a 7.3-compatible
    LinuxWacom makes it to Debian.

  * Lots of issues with Xinput:
    - Coordinate origins are messed up after Xrandr rotation
    - The automatic window resize during writing occasionally messes up
      coordinate origins
    - Xorg 7.3/LinuxWacom 7.8.3 (patched) generates button 3 for left-click

  * Icon cache does not appear to update after installing the Debian package.
    Apparently a distribution-specific issue with CDBS.

  * Window docking (moving window inside of struts) does not work with Metacity.

  * Bottom-docked windows don't popup the back buffer menu correctly.
    Appears to be a bug with Metacity itself.

  * Docked windows overlap panels sometimes.
