# Cell Writer Database Schema File
# (View in emacs viz <meta>-x org-mode)
#
# This file defines  the database schema.
#
# To build the database in sqlite3, do the following:
#   gnatcoll_db2ada -dbtype=sqlite -createdb -dbmodel=<filename> \
#                   -dbname=cell_writer.db
# To build the Ada source, code, type the following:
#   gnatcoll_db2ada -dbmodel=<filename> -api=Database -adacreate
#
# where <filename> is the name of this file (nominally database_schema.dbmodel).
